The aim of this project was to create a lobsterpot for jellyfish catching.

ahving designed a jellyfish with everysingle bit of stealthing, crafty navigation and tools to get about i decided it was prudent to make sure there was an equeally capable device to catch them - both to make sure they could be controlled and to study their evolution by actually looking at the altered code of those that were captured post release/replication in the wild.

ofc in all reality i was designing an antivirus with firewalling and a high degree of ai - but that's a dull way to lookk at a project that can be so much more fun!

this project has not  only the same AAI brain that the jellyfish was based on - an RNN/CNN/LTSM three way GAN assisted by central ganglion with cellular wutomaton control layer featyuring crosstalk, but also, variously:
- Behavioral Analysis
- Signature-based Detection:
- Quarantine Protocol
- Reinforcement Learning
- Evolutionary Algorithms
- Behavioral Analysis Engine
- Threat Intelligence
- Learning Database
- Self-Healing
- Adaptive Firewall
- Collaboration with other lobster pots

the code
it's initially coded in  Python too take advaantage of pytorch/kura/tensorflow/etc. but may well bee converted over to C++ later on.

it seems to have topped out about 2000 lines of code and frankly i think i'm about done with the kind of activity that would add anything so i reckon  that gives some idea of it's scope.

dependencies
- it needs `ChromeDriver.exe` and the `AlienVault_OTX_API_Key.env` key file to run right now tho i might bundle them in with the python in a package or even hardcode em right into some C++.
- also it requires a hella lotta libratries so getting it crammed down into something selfcontained also has appeal there.

i'vee gone right through versions from 0.0.1 to 1.0.x and were now officially working, just a few teething tiny issues so basically ihis is a living breathing lobsterpot lifeform ready to be trained and released to munch its way round the world!

this was written in about 20hrs btw so pls be forgiving if there's any weirds or errs.
